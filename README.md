# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview

The following is a list of subdirectores in the project directory.
The instructions for Module13 had us create many branches with their own subdirectories, without merging the code back into the main branch.
That's why there are so many.
The actual 'Module13 Challenge' work is in the **Earthquake_Challenge** subdirectory.
Please see the README.md there.
